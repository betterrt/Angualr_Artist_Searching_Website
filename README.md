# Artist_Searching_Website

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.0.

## Objective

The objective is to build up a good-looking Website that enables user to search for artists by name and displays the results as cards that can be clicked for details. Once a card is clicked, the information of this artist including biography, birthday, death day, nationality, artworks will be shown. Artworks are also clickable cards, which can show more artworks of the same category. 

## Backend

The backend is developed using Node.js, which is uploaded in another repository called 'Backend_Artist_Web_Application'.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
