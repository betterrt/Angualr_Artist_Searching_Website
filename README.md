# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.0.

## Objective

The objective is to build up a good-looking Website that enables user to search for artists by name and displays the results       
as cards that can be clicked for details. Once a card is clicked, the information of this artist including biography, birthday, nationality, artworks
will be shown. Artworks are also clickable cards, which will show the user the category of current artwork. 

## Backend

The backend is developed using Node.js, which is uploaded in another repository called 'Backend_Artist_Web_Application'.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
